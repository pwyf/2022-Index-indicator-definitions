# 2022-Index-indicator-definitions
This consultation ran until 27 September 2021. We will confirm the final tests that will be used in the next Aid Transparency Index shortly.

Please note that this consultation was only on data quality tests used for IATI XML data and not on the Index indicators or the overall methodology. 
All indicators used in the Aid Transparency Index will be retained.
