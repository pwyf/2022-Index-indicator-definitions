## Go straight to the [Indicators to view the discussion &raquo;](https://github.com/pwyf/2022-Index-indicator-definitions/issues)

This consultation will run from 13 until 27 September 2021. We will confirm the final tests that will be used in the next Aid Transparency Index shortly after.

Please note that this consultation is only on data quality tests used for IATI XML data and not on the Index indicators or the overall methodology. 
All indicators used in the Aid Transparency Index will be retained.
