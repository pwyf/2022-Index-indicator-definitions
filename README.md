This consultation is now closed for comment. Publish What You Fund is reviewing the comments and will post responses in due course. We will confirm the final tests that will be used in the next Aid Transparency Index shortly after.

Please note that this consultation is only on data quality tests used for IATI XML data and not on the Index indicators or the overall methodology. 
All indicators used in the Aid Transparency Index will be retained.
